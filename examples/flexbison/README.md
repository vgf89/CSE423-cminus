This is an example of using the flex and bison lexer and parser generators on a
simple "dinner" language.

flex and bison packages must be installed on your system. Your mileage may vary
with the older lex and yacc.

The dinner executable (lexer + parser) can be built by running "make" in a
terminal. This executable is hard-coded to parse the in.dinner file.
